<p>An attempt at making a (text-based) game based on the game SBURB from Homestuck. This is at the moment an incomplete project, and would be marked private if it was possible. Irregardless, please feel free to contribute code / fork if you think there could be something useful, though I ask that only people who have read Homestuck do this. </p>

<p><br>-------------------INSTALLING---------------------------<br>
This game is not complete enough to really install or configure yet. Just download the project and run 'Index.java' to begin, though I can't guarantee it will work. </p>
