# sburb
An attempt at making a (text-based) game based on the game SBURB from Homestuck. This is at the moment an incomplete project, and would be marked private if it was possible. Irregardless, please feel free to contribute code / fork if you think there could be something useful, though I ask that only people who have read Homestuck do this. 

------------------COPYRIGHT INFORMATION----------------
All code belongs to Drew Thompson under the MIT License. This means that you are free to take and use for any purpose any pieces of code, provided that you credit the owner (Drew Thompson). 

The concept that this game is based on is the property of Andrew Hussie. No profit will be made of this game, as it is just a fun fan project! Credit for all the 'fun variables' and basic game structure goes to Andrew Hussie. 

-------------------INSTALLING---------------------------
This game is not complete enough to really install or configure yet. Just download the project and run 'Index.java' to begin, though I can't guarantee it will work.
